1. Stock Account Management
a. Desc -> Write a program to read in Stock Names, Number of Share, Share Price.
Print a Stock Report with the total value of each Stock and the total value of

"9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"). Shuffle the cards using Random
method and then distribute 9 Cards to 4 Players and Print the Cards received by
the 4 Players using 2D Array...

5. Extend the above program to create a Player Object having Deck of Cards, and
having ability to Sort by Rank and maintain the cards in a Queue implemented
using Linked List. Do not use any Collection Library. Further the Players are also
arranged in Queue. Finally Print the Player and the Cards received by each
